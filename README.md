# Nodejs-00
Hello, I created an App that you can Login, Register, Show Data User, Add Friends and Remove Friends.
I used Mariadb connection that's why npm installs mariadb.
I changed the connection to Mysql but I put in comments the connection with Mariadb.

To Add Friends first you have to create some users then the app will show you a list of all users that you can connect.

Password is encrypted with bcrypt.

To do a Registration you needs this requirements:
- Fill all the form.
- +18.

Probably I should have used dotenv to not show the sensitive information.
